# COVID-19 Visualizer 🦠😷📈

## Inspiration 💡
We were able to get a lot of ideas from leading sources in healthcare, news, and research that had already set up much more advanced visualizations of covid data, such as John Hopkins or the New York Times.
## What it does 📋📊
This web-based application helps visualize which countries use a certain COVID-19 vaccine using a color-coded world map and a drop down feature that allows one to view different global usages of various vaccine releases. 
## How we built it 👩🏻‍💻
Using python, pandas, and numpy, we were able to calculate and show some patterns about different countries use of COVID vaccinations
## Challenges we ran into 🧗🏼‍♀️🤯
Data sanitization and reworking the datasets we found to fit what we needed to visualize an answer to the question
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 👏🏽🤩😉
Being able to figure out how to adjust and reformat the data to answer the questions we had, as well as visualize them in a dashboard was exciting. 
## What we learned🧐🤓
This HackHers experience gave us a crash course in Dash and data visualization, and introduced us to the many challenges that data scientists face when trying to identify trends in data or conduct further research. 
## What's next for COVID-19 Visualizer 👩🏻‍💻
After improving crucial functionality and working off bugs as they come up, we'd also be interested in developing an app for this platform so that our work isn't just limited to a web browser on a computer.
